                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited), is the top level of the men's
                English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with
                the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches
                (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons,
                with occasional weekday evening fixtures.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the
                Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a
                lucrative television rights sale to Sky. From 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals
                were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and
                32 games respectively. The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is
                responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned central
                payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016-17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English
                Football League (EFL) clubs.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million
                homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018-19 season, the average Premier
                League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated
                attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981. Most stadium
                occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on
                performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021. The English top-flight has
                produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having
                won fourteen European trophies in total.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh
                clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3),
                Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).

                <p class="para1">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premier League, also affectionately known as The Premiership, is the pride of football in
                    the United Kingdom. The league is relatively young and was formed in response to the decline
                    of the sport in UK during the 1980s. Football stadiums were being neglected and English football
                    clubs were banned from competition in Europe as a result of the disaster that occurred during
                    the 1985 European Cup Tournament at Heysel Stadium in Brussels. The Football League First
                    Division, which had been the major English football league since 1888, lagged well behind its
                    Italian and Spanish rivals and numerous top English players chose to play abroad.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the early 1990s, things begin to turn around as England successfully reached the semi-finals
                    in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. And Europe’s governing body of football, UEFA, lifted the five year ban
                    on European competitions in that same year. The league has seen an explosion in growth and is
                    currently the most watched sporting league in the world.
                    In February of 1992, The FA Premier League was formed and the first games were played in August
                    of the same year. Originally, there were 22 clubs in league.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, currently there are 22 teams in the league. The FA Premier League’s name was officially
                    changed to the The Premier League in 2007. The league is also known as Barclays Premier League
                    since its official sponsor is Barclays Bank. Currently the league is at the top of the English
                    football league system and at the end of the 2007-2008 season had completed 16 seasons of football.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premier League’s football seasons run from August to May and each team plays a total of 38
                    games. Over the years, a total of 40 football clubs have participated in The Premier League.
                    However, of the 40 teams that have competed in The Premier League, only 4 have won the UK Premiership
                    title – those teams include Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Arsenal, and Chelsea. The current
                    football champion is Manchester United who holds the record of winning the most Premiership
                    titles – Manchester United boasts a total of 10 UK Premiership titles.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premier League is structured as a corporation with the 20 participating football clubs
                    holding interest in the league. Each participating club in The Premiership is treated as a
                    shareholder and is entitled to one vote on the issues such as contracts and rule changes. The
                    chairman, chief executive, and board of directors oversee daily operations of The Premier 
                    League are elected by the shareholders. Though the Football Association is not involved
                    directly in the daily operations, it is treated a special shareholder and holds the power of
                    veto during the election of the chief executive and chairman whenever new rules are put in
                    place by the league.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UK Premiership is wildly popular throughout the world and owes much of its success to media
                    coverage of football sporting events. The decision in 1992 to assign broadcasting rights to
                    BSkyB has paid off enormously. Over a half a billion people follow the league and it is
                    particularly popular in Asia, where it is the most widely promoted sports program.
